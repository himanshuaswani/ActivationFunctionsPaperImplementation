# ActivationFunctionsPaperImplementation

This is the official code repository for the paper Activation Function: Do They Represent A Trade-Off Between Modular Nature of Neural Networks And Task Performance.

The paper is available <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.07793.pdf">here</a>.

Structure of the repository: 

    - There are three files: official_train_mlp.py, official_spearman_method.py, custom_function.py
    - The official_train_mlp.py file implements the same architecture as described in the paper.
    - The official_spearman_method.py is the method 2 implementation.
    - custom_function.py contains the required functions to implement n cut computations.
    - The function visualize_clusters has been added to aid pictorial clustering of neurons.
